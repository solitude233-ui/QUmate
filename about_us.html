                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p>
                    QUmate strives to implement a housing and roommate finding service that is
                    free of judgement of any sorts for all to enjoy. By creating an account with QUmate, you agree to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Treat all other users with respect</li>
                    <li>Not participate in bullying or inappropriate behaviours</li>
                    <li>Not discriminate against other users for any reason.</li>
                    <li>Chat with other users for the sole purpose of finding potential housing and/or potential roommate.</li>
                    <li>Provide accurate and valid information about yourself and/or the housing you are listing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Failing to meet these conditions can lead to account and postings removal as well as a report to authorities when applicable.
                </p>
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team also highly values our user's confidentiality. We aim to provide a secure
                    environment that protects our user's data and personal information. Additionally,
                    we will ensure that all listings are validated, and our users are validated before use
                    in our site. We also value input from our users in detecting suspicious accounts and/or postings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we place emphasis on security, it is important that users employ methods that keep themselves secure. This could include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Only messaging users on our platform until trust is built</li>
                    <li>Only transferring money to users after viewing housing and meeting the roommates living there</li>
                    <li>If a posting appears suspicious, remain cautious and report it if needed</li>
                    <li>Ensure you have someone you know that can assist in viewing housing and/or roommates</li>
                    <li>If a situation appears to be unsafe, call someone you know for assistance</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
